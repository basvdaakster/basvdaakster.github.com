	<title>NuggetEco - Bukkit Plugin - By Basfreak</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>NuggetEco</h1>
<p>
    NuggetEco is an economy plugin for bukkit. NuggetEco is currently in development.
    <br /><br />
    NuggetEco is not a standard economy plugin. Most economy plugins use a "virtual" balance, NuggetEco does not.
    NuggetEco uses Gold Nuggets as coins, you must have Gold Nuggets in your inventory to buy items, so think twice before heading out to a shop in a PvP world. You must keep your coins safe
    yourself, there is no bank, I recommend using a protection plugin so you can create a secure chest to put your Nuggets in.
